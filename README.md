# Shell-Fork-and-Exec-
It’s an implementation of a simple command line shell in C that interacts with user and has some of the limitations as below: 
•	Enter single line commands 
•	Arguments separated by white space
•	Built in cd command
•	No piping and redirection
•	Exit with ctr+c
Tested on MAC terminal with several commands including ls, cat, grep, head, date, man, file and cd …etc.
